    <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
    <p>Namaste! Thanks for visiting my profile! Prioritizing quality over quantity is essential in educational services.

After a decade of teaching math and language both nationally and internationally, my passion for helping individuals understand these subjects has grown mature and refined. I am committed to helping students improve their math skills and achieve their full potential. My tutoring approach is collaborative and incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) technology to prompt and guide students' learning. During the sessions, students can feel comfortable asking questions and making mistakes as they learn from both the communication/translation in the session and AI prompting. I aim to assist my students in developing a robust foundation of mathematical knowledge and critical thinking skills. With AI prompts, every student has the potential to achieve extraordinary success.

As an experienced educator, I've worked with students of all ages and levels and tailor my teaching techniques to meet their unique needs and learning styles. I stay up-to-date with the latest education and research techniques through virtual professional development workshops and integrate various math and AI software as necessary to enhance my teaching approach. Ultimately, my goal is to inspire and empower students to become confident, self-sufficient learners and researchers, ready to tackle any challenge inside and outside the classroom.

Language proficiency and understanding AI responses are vital for academic success. Are you ready to begin your learning journey?</p>
